Parrying Daggers is a mod that adds in hotkey-activated parrying, in the form of parrying daggers. 

Most hostile projectiles can be parried, but a only a limited number can be reflected (most bullets/arrows/straight shot projectiles can be reflected).

Reflected projectiles gain a velocity and damage boost, become friendly, and cause hit enemies to drop hearts. 

You can also parry specific friendly projectiles if you time it right, such as bullets and arrows, to boost their velocity and tighten their spread. 

Enemies themselves can be parried as well, providing brief immunity frames.

There's also a number of unique interactions if you parry certain enemies. The list includes the following:

-Crawltipedes (Instant kill)
-Servants of Cthulhu and Creepers (High damage)
-Probes (Instant kill, with a large explosion)
-Mothron Eggs (Instant kill)
-Tethered The Hungry (Instantly detatches)
-Snatchers, Man Eaters, and Angry Trappers (High damage)

Be sure to check your hotkey settings!
